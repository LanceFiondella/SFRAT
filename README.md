# SFRAT

### The Software Failure and Reliability Assessment Tool
This is the Python implementation of the Software Failure and Reliability Assessment Tool to evaluate model-fit curves on failure data.
## Installation
This software requires Python 3 to run. For Windows installation, install from their official site: https://www.python.org/downloads/ . For Unix, install using your package manager.

The SFRAT requires Python libraries listed in `requirements.txt`. Run `setup.py` with Python (likely via double-clicking) to install the required libraries. This should open a separate window displaying the installation progress.
