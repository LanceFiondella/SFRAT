# SFRAT

### The Software Failure and Reliability Assessment Tool
This is the Python implementation of the Software Failure and Reliability Assessment Tool to evaluate model-fit curves on failure data.
## Installation
This software requires Python 3 to run. For Windows installation, install from their official site: https://www.python.org/downloads/ . For Unix, install using your package manager.

[Download](https://github.com/LanceFiondella/SFRAT/archive/refs/heads/master.zip) and extract (if necessary) the software from GitHub (or via Git). Run `setup.py` with Python (likely via double-clicking) to install the required libraries. This should open a separate window displaying the installation progress. If the setup script causes an error, re-run the script.

## Running
After installing Python and SFRAT's required libraries, run `SFRAT.pyw` with Python, again likely via double-click.
